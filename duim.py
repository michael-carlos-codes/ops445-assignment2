OPS445 Assignment 2 - Winter 2025
Program: duim.py 
Author: Michael Carlos
The python code in this file (duim.py) is original work written by
"Student Name". No code in this file is copied from any other source 
except those provided by the course instructor, including any person, 
textbook, or online resource. I have not shared this python script 
with anyone or anything except for submission for grading.  
I understand that the Academic Honesty Policy will be enforced and 
violators will be reported and appropriate action will be taken.

Description: This script mimics the behavior of the `du` command but 
             includes additional functionality such as graphical representation.
